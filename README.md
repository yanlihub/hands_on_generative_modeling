# Hands-On Generative Modeling

This repository, **Hands-On Generative Modeling**, is designed for learning and exploring various generative models.  
It focuses mainly on **tabular data** and provides **minimal examples** along with simple **training procedures**.  

The goal of this repository is to help practitioners understand **how different generative models work** through concrete code examples, making the learning process practical and hands-on.
